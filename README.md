## :rocket: About the test

The test consists of designing, layout and developing from scratch a small wizard that simulates something as typical as the creation of a password for a user. What we want you to do is to propose a 3-step wizard in which a user receives information that they are about to create a new password, a form where they are asked for a series of data to create the password and a page end of operation feedback.
